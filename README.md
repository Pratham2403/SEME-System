## PROJECT IDEA

Designing a `SEME` for the campus of `IIT(ISM) Dhanbad`

## PROJECT BRIEFINGS

1. The project devises a way to allow people to conveniently move in and out of campus using the best possible security forces and systems.
2. In this system, the entire inflow of traffic can only be from the main gate. However, people may exit from multiple exit points allowing the conservation of fuel and energy.
3. Various concepts pertaining to `Operating Systems` will be used including process scheduling for sending warning messages and channelising influx
4. The project also uses the `memory mapping` for efficient space usage.
